# Embedded-Final

Integrates different laboratories completed during CE 4370 Embedded Microprocessor Systems course. 

Utilizes MSP430F5529.

1. LEDS: Each of the LEDs on the board corresponds to the numbers 1 through 8 on the user's keyboard. With each press of the numerical key, the corresponding LED toggles.

2. IOs: This option tests the status of the two buttons on the board (north button and south button).

3. ADC: The voltage value input to the board's potentiometer is displayed on the terminal and the LCD screen.

4. A timer value is selected using the thumbwheel on the board, setting the delay value in seconds (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 s) that a safe will remain open. The open safe is represented by LED1.

5. Each pixel on the LCD screen is illuminated one by one.
